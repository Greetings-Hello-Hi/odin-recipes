    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egg tofu is a simple and warming Chinese dish that reminds me of home. I have fond memories of weeknight dinners where my mother would set a plate of freshly pan-fried egg tofu on the table alongside a platter of sauce-laden vegetables and bowls of white rice. Now you can learn how to prepare and enjoy this comforting dish with your loved ones too!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tube of egg tofu - this is usually sold in Asian supermarkets</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of canola oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of corn starch</li>
        <li>1 tsp of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut open the tube of egg tofu. Discard the packaging.</li>
        <li>Slice the egg tofu into 1/2 inch rounds. Lay the slices on a towel to drain the moisture from them. Let them sit for at least five minutes.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg into a small bowl. Add the salt and pepper and beat the mixture well.</li>
        <li>Add the oil into a 12-inch pan and begin heating it over a low-medium flame.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cornstarch on one side of each tofu slice.</li>
        <li>Once the oil in the pan is heated, increase the flame to medium-high, add the tofu slices, corn-starched side down, and pan fry them until that side is golden brown. Then flip the slices.</li>
        <li>When the other side of the tofu begins turning golden brown, add the egg-salt-pepper mixture to the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the egg mixture has been cooked to your preference, turn off the stove and add soy sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, preferably with rice, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
